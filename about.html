        <p>I'm a guy who loves software and building teams to help customers succeed. </p>

        <p>I have lots of experience with distributed systems at scale. I'm a fan of Python, C/C++. I think JavaScript is a necessary evil for doing real things. I have a hankering for getting numeric computations to run be beautiful, i.e. run fast, avoid extraneous copies of data, fit in cache, evaluating compiler output, measuring, repeating </p>
